# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define *how* tools work. This file is for *your* specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:
- Fitness tracker integration
- Apple Health / Google Fit connection
- Timer or interval apps
- Gym locations and equipment notes
- Anything environment-specific

## Examples

```markdown
### Trackers
- Apple Watch → syncs to Health app
- Whoop → recovery scores available

### Locations
- Outdoor gym → 15 min run, has pull-up bars at 3 heights
- Climbing gym → "The Crag", open until 10pm

### Apps
- Interval timer: "Seconds Pro"
- Workout music: Spotify "Beast Mode" playlist
```

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.
