## Session Notes
- Saturday long run/hike day: Conor chose a slow hike.
- Left heel pain presents more plantar; groin issue feels like inner-thigh tightness (old strain flares when tight / squatting a lot).

## Workout: Long hike
| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Progression | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Hike (easy) | 60 min | Slow / easy pace | Felt nice; kept it chill. |

## Flags
- Left heel + groin: needs targeted evening mobility/soft tissue focus.
