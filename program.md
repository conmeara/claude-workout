# Training Plan

## Overview
- **Goal:** Freestanding handstand by end of 2026, fat loss, calisthenics skill development
- **Days per week:** 7 (varied intensity)
- **Program style:** Modified Reddit Recommended Routine + Daily Handstand Practice
- **Started:** 2026-01-27

## The Why

You have a solid strength base from 5x5. Now we're building skill, relative strength, and work capacity. The run to/from the outdoor gym adds ~30 min of Zone 2 cardio on training days — that's your fat loss engine. Daily handstand practice builds the neurological patterns needed for balance. Climbing adds pulling volume and grip work while keeping training fun.

## Weekly Schedule

| Day | Type | Location | Duration |
|-----|------|----------|----------|
| Monday | RR Workout A | Outdoor Gym | 30 min run + 45-60 min workout |
| Tuesday | Easy Run / Active Recovery | Neighborhood | 30-45 min |
| Wednesday | RR Workout B | Outdoor Gym | 30 min run + 45-60 min workout |
| Thursday | Easy Run / Ruck (AM) + optional Climbing (PM) | Neighborhood + Climbing Gym | 30-60 min + (optional) 60-90 min |
| Friday | RR Workout A | Outdoor Gym | 30 min run + 45-60 min workout |
| Saturday | Hike OR Long Run | Outdoors | 60-90 min |
| Sunday | Active Recovery | Home | Light movement, mobility |

**Daily Non-Negotiables:**
- Morning: Handstand practice (10-15 min)
- Evening: Mobility routine (10-15 min)

**Weather Adaptations:**
- Rain on RR day → Climbing gym OR Home Pull-up Routine
- Rain on run day → Climbing gym OR Rest
- Rain on climbing day → Already covered

---

## Progression Scheme

### Strength Movements
Build to **3x8 with good form** before progressing to the next level. When you hit 3x8, move up. If you can't get 3x5 at the new progression, drop back and add a set (4x8) before trying again.

### Skill Work
Time-based holds: Build to **3x30 seconds** before progressing.
Handstands: Build **consistent 30-second holds** at each stage before moving on.

### Running
Keep it conversational pace. You should be able to talk. Heart rate roughly 130-150 BPM. Speed will naturally improve as weight drops and aerobic base builds.

---

## Deload Protocol

**Every 4th week:**
- RR workouts: Drop to 2 sets per exercise, same progressions
- Running: Cut distance/time by 40%
- Climbing: Keep it fun, no projecting hard routes
- Handstands: Maintain practice, no new progressions
- Mobility: Keep full routine

**Signs you need an unscheduled deload:**
- Grip strength noticeably down
- Joints aching (not muscle soreness)
- Sleep quality tanking
- Dreading workouts for 3+ days straight

### Handstand Progression Plan

**Daily Practice Protocol — 10-15 min every morning**

Do this before breakfast, when you're fresh but not fueled. Consistency beats intensity.

#### Phase 1: Wall Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

| Exercise | Sets x Time | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Wrist Prep | 2 min | Circles, extensions, stretches |
| Wall Plank | 3x30 sec | Feet on wall, hands on floor, body at 45 degrees |
| Chest-to-Wall Hold | 5-8 attempts, 10-30 sec each | Walk up wall, chest facing wall, hands 6-8 inches from wall |
| Wall Shoulder Taps | 3x5 each hand | In chest-to-wall position, shift weight and tap shoulder |

**Goal:** 3x30 sec chest-to-wall hold with straight body line.

#### Phase 2: Wall Refinement (Weeks 5-8)

| Exercise | Sets x Time | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Wrist Prep | 2 min | Same routine |
| Chest-to-Wall Hold | 3x30-45 sec | Focus on pushing through shoulders, squeezing glutes |
| Single Leg Lift-Off | 3x5 each leg | Pull one foot off wall, hold 3-5 sec |
| Heel Pulls | 5x5 | Both feet, pull heels 2-3 inches from wall, return |
| Back-to-Wall Kick-ups | 10 attempts | Practice kick-up technique |

**Goal:** Clean kick-up to back-to-wall position. Heel pulls without falling.

#### Phase 3: Balance Development (Weeks 9-16)

| Exercise | Sets x Time | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Wrist Prep | 2 min | Same routine |
| Back-to-Wall Hold | 3x30-45 sec | Practice using fingers to balance |
| Toe Pulls | 5x5 | Pull toes off wall, hold as long as possible |
| Kick-up to Freestanding Attempts | 10-15 attempts | Kick up, try to balance without wall |

**Goal:** Consistent 5-10 second freestanding holds.

#### Phase 4: Freestanding (Weeks 17+)

| Exercise | Sets x Time | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Wrist Prep | 2 min | Same routine |
| Kick-up Practice | 15-20 attempts | No wall, open space |
| Bail Practice | 5 reps each side | Cartwheel out, pirouette out |
| Max Hold Attempts | 5 attempts | Go for time |

**Goal:** 30+ second freestanding handstand.

#### Handstand Cues to Remember:
1. **Push the floor away** — Active shoulders, no collapsing
2. **Squeeze your butt** — Posterior pelvic tilt, no banana back
3. **Point your toes** — Full body tension
4. **Fingers are balance** — Dig in to prevent over-balance
5. **Palm heel pressure** — Push through to prevent under-balance
6. **Look at hands** — Neutral neck, eyes between hands

### Nightly Mobility Routine — 14‑Day Whole‑Body Overhaul (10–15 min)

**Overhaul start date:** 2026-01-29

This replaces the “same routine every night” approach with the *Supple Leopard* **14‑day template**: **3 mobilizations/day**, every day.

**Daily structure (10–15 min total):**

- **MOB 1 — Coach pick (2–4 min):** Pick 1 mobilization that targets your *problem of the day* **based on your notes + today’s/upcoming training** (stiff spot, pain trend, or a position you want to improve). If you didn’t log anything, default to the single biggest limiter you feel right now.
- **MOB 2 — Archetype (2–4 min):** Choose 1 mobilization from the day’s **movement archetype**.
- **MOB 3 — Body area (2–4 min):** Choose 1 mobilization from the day’s **body area**.

**Rule:** spend your time on the **one joint** that’s limiting you. Don’t turn this into a random stretching buffet.

**Equipment:** lacrosse/tennis ball, wall/couch, optional band.

#### 14‑day map (what to hit each day)

**Week 1**
- **Mon:** Archetype = **Overhead** · Body area = **Area 1: Jaw/Head/Neck**
- **Tue:** Archetype = **Squat** · Body area = **Area 13: Calf**
- **Wed:** Archetype = **Hang** · Body area = **Area 2: Upper Back**
- **Thu:** Archetype = **Front Rack** · Body area = **Area 6: Trunk**
- **Fri:** Archetype = **Pistol** · Body area = **Area 12: Shin**
- **Sat:** Archetype = **Lunge** · Body area = **Area 14: Ankle/Foot/Toes**
- **Sun:** Archetype = **Press** · Body area = **Area 3: Posterior Shoulder/Lat/Serratus**

**Week 2**
- **Mon:** Archetype = **Overhead** · Body area = **Area 5: Arm**
- **Tue:** Archetype = **Squat** · Body area = **Area 9: Adductors**
- **Wed:** Archetype = **Hang** · Body area = **Area 10: Hamstrings**
- **Thu:** Archetype = **Front Rack** · Body area = **Area 11: Knee**
- **Fri:** Archetype = **Pistol** · Body area = **Area 7: Glutes/Hip Capsules**
- **Sat:** Archetype = **Lunge** · Body area = **Area 8: Hip Flexors/Quads**
- **Sun:** Archetype = **Press** · Body area = **Area 4: Anterior Shoulder/Chest**

#### Sample program (Beginner track)
Use these as defaults if you don’t want to think. Swap any slot when a different area is clearly the limiter.

## Running Guidelines

**To/From Outdoor Gym:**
- 15 min each way = 30 min total Zone 2 cardio
- Keep it conversational — you should be able to talk
- This is your primary fat loss driver
- Don't race. Consistency > intensity.

**Tuesday Easy Run / Active Recovery:**
- 30-45 min easy running OR
- 30 min walk + mobility OR
- 20 min easy run + 20 min stretching

**Saturday Long Run (if not climbing):**
- 45-60 min at easy pace
- Build duration over time, not speed
- Good podcast/audiobook time

---

## Climbing Integration

**Purpose:** Fun, pulling volume, grip strength, problem-solving

**Guidelines:**
- Don't project hard stuff the day before RR workouts
- It counts as pulling volume — if you climb hard, back off pull-up volume that week
- Bouldering = more intense, shorter. Top rope = more endurance.
- On RR deload weeks, climb for fun, don't push grades

**Suggested Approach:**
- Thursday: Regular session, work on technique and moderate problems
- Saturday (if climbing): Can push harder since Sunday is rest

---

## Benchmarks

Test these every 4 weeks (on deload week):

| Test | Measure | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Max Pull-ups | Total reps in one set | Stop when form breaks |
| Max Dips | Total reps in one set | Full ROM |
| Max Handstand Hold | Time (wall or free) | Best of 3 attempts |
| Pistol Squat Progress | Current level achieved | Both legs |
| L-Sit Hold | Max time | Note progression level |
| 5K Time (optional) | Time | If you want to track running |

---

## When to Adjust

**Signs it's working:**
- Progressing through exercise levels every 2-4 weeks
- Handstand hold time increasing
- Pull-up and dip numbers going up
- Weight trending down (slowly — 0.5-1 lb/week is ideal)
- Energy good, sleep good, enjoying training

**Signs to modify:**
- Stuck at same progression for 4+ weeks
- Joint pain (not muscle soreness)
- Dreading sessions consistently
- Always exhausted

**When to move on:**
- Handstand goal achieved — time for new skill targets
