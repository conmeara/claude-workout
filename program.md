# Training Plan

## Overview
- **Goal:** Freestanding handstand by end of 2026, fat loss, calisthenics skill development
- **Days per week:** 7 (varied intensity)
- **Program style:** Modified Reddit Recommended Routine + Daily Handstand Practice
- **Started:** 2026-01-27

## The Why

You have a solid strength base from 5x5. Now we're building skill, relative strength, and work capacity. The run to/from the outdoor gym adds ~30 min of Zone 2 cardio on training days — that's your fat loss engine. Daily handstand practice builds the neurological patterns needed for balance. Climbing adds pulling volume and grip work while keeping training fun.

## Weekly Schedule

| Day | Type | Location | Duration |
|-----|------|----------|----------|
| Monday | RR Workout A | Outdoor Gym | 30 min run + 45-60 min workout |
| Tuesday | Easy Run / Active Recovery | Neighborhood | 30-45 min |
| Wednesday | RR Workout B | Outdoor Gym | 30 min run + 45-60 min workout |
| Thursday | Climbing | Climbing Gym | 60-90 min |
| Friday | RR Workout A | Outdoor Gym | 30 min run + 45-60 min workout |
| Saturday | Hike OR Long Run | Outdoors | 60-90 min |
| Sunday | Active Recovery | Home | Light movement, mobility |

**Daily Non-Negotiables:**
- Morning: Handstand practice (10-15 min)
- Evening: Mobility routine (10-15 min)

**Weather Adaptations:**
- Rain on RR day → Climbing gym OR Home Pull-up Routine
- Rain on run day → Climbing gym OR Rest
- Rain on climbing day → Already covered

---

## Progression Scheme

### Strength Movements
Build to **3x8 with good form** before progressing to the next level. When you hit 3x8, move up. If you can't get 3x5 at the new progression, drop back and add a set (4x8) before trying again.

### Skill Work
Time-based holds: Build to **3x30 seconds** before progressing.
Handstands: Build **consistent 30-second holds** at each stage before moving on.

### Running
Keep it conversational pace. You should be able to talk. Heart rate roughly 130-150 BPM. Speed will naturally improve as weight drops and aerobic base builds.

---

## Deload Protocol

**Every 4th week:**
- RR workouts: Drop to 2 sets per exercise, same progressions
- Running: Cut distance/time by 40%
- Climbing: Keep it fun, no projecting hard routes
- Handstands: Maintain practice, no new progressions
- Mobility: Keep full routine

**Signs you need an unscheduled deload:**
- Grip strength noticeably down
- Joints aching (not muscle soreness)
- Sleep quality tanking
- Dreading workouts for 3+ days straight

### Handstand Progression Plan

**Daily Practice Protocol — 10-15 min every morning**

Do this before breakfast, when you're fresh but not fueled. Consistency beats intensity.

#### Phase 1: Wall Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

| Exercise | Sets x Time | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Wrist Prep | 2 min | Circles, extensions, stretches |
| Wall Plank | 3x30 sec | Feet on wall, hands on floor, body at 45 degrees |
| Chest-to-Wall Hold | 5-8 attempts, 10-30 sec each | Walk up wall, chest facing wall, hands 6-8 inches from wall |
| Wall Shoulder Taps | 3x5 each hand | In chest-to-wall position, shift weight and tap shoulder |

**Goal:** 3x30 sec chest-to-wall hold with straight body line.

#### Phase 2: Wall Refinement (Weeks 5-8)

| Exercise | Sets x Time | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Wrist Prep | 2 min | Same routine |
| Chest-to-Wall Hold | 3x30-45 sec | Focus on pushing through shoulders, squeezing glutes |
| Single Leg Lift-Off | 3x5 each leg | Pull one foot off wall, hold 3-5 sec |
| Heel Pulls | 5x5 | Both feet, pull heels 2-3 inches from wall, return |
| Back-to-Wall Kick-ups | 10 attempts | Practice kick-up technique |

**Goal:** Clean kick-up to back-to-wall position. Heel pulls without falling.

#### Phase 3: Balance Development (Weeks 9-16)

| Exercise | Sets x Time | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Wrist Prep | 2 min | Same routine |
| Back-to-Wall Hold | 3x30-45 sec | Practice using fingers to balance |
| Toe Pulls | 5x5 | Pull toes off wall, hold as long as possible |
| Kick-up to Freestanding Attempts | 10-15 attempts | Kick up, try to balance without wall |

**Goal:** Consistent 5-10 second freestanding holds.

#### Phase 4: Freestanding (Weeks 17+)

| Exercise | Sets x Time | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Wrist Prep | 2 min | Same routine |
| Kick-up Practice | 15-20 attempts | No wall, open space |
| Bail Practice | 5 reps each side | Cartwheel out, pirouette out |
| Max Hold Attempts | 5 attempts | Go for time |

**Goal:** 30+ second freestanding handstand.

#### Handstand Cues to Remember:
1. **Push the floor away** — Active shoulders, no collapsing
2. **Squeeze your butt** — Posterior pelvic tilt, no banana back
3. **Point your toes** — Full body tension
4. **Fingers are balance** — Dig in to prevent over-balance
5. **Palm heel pressure** — Push through to prevent under-balance
6. **Look at hands** — Neutral neck, eyes between hands

### Nightly Mobility Routine (10-15 min)

Based on Kelly Starrett's *Becoming a Supple Leopard* methodology. Do this every night, non-negotiable. It's your recovery work.

**The Supple Leopard Philosophy:**

Starrett's system is built on three core principles:

1. **Midline Stabilization** — Your spine is the foundation. Maintain neutral spine and engaged core in all movements. A disorganized spine bleeds power and creates compensation patterns.

2. **Laws of Torque** — Create rotational force at joints to generate stability. External rotation at hips and shoulders "screws" you into stable positions. This is why we cue "knees out" in squats and "break the bar" in pressing.

3. **One-Joint Rule** — Address one joint at a time when mobilizing. Don't try to stretch everything at once. Isolate the restriction, attack it, then move on.

**The Approach:**
- Tissues adapt to positions you spend time in (sitting = tight hip flexors)
- Mobilization restores sliding surfaces and joint capsule function
- Consistency beats intensity — 10 min daily > 60 min weekly
- Test/retest: Check a position, mobilize, check again

**Equipment needed:** Lacrosse ball (or tennis ball), wall or couch, resistance band (optional)

#### Hip Opening (5 min)

| Exercise | Duration | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Couch Stretch | 2 min each side | Back knee against wall/couch, squeeze glute, stay upright |
| Pigeon Pose | 90 sec each side | Keep hips square, fold forward if possible |
| 90/90 Hip Switch | 10 reps | Knees at 90 degrees, rotate between positions |

*Tight hip flexors from sitting will limit your handstand line. The couch stretch is non-negotiable.*

#### T-Spine (3-4 min)

| Exercise | Duration | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| T-Spine Extension on Floor | 2 min | Foam roller or lacrosse balls along spine, arms overhead, extend over ball |
| Thread the Needle | 10 each side | On all fours, reach through and rotate |
| Cat-Cow | 10 reps | Slow and controlled |

*Thoracic mobility is critical for handstands and overhead pressing. Don't skip this.*

#### Shoulder Work (3-4 min)

| Exercise | Duration | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Lacrosse Ball Pec Smash | 90 sec each side | Ball against wall, lean into pec, move arm |
| Lat Stretch | 60 sec each side | Arm overhead, side bend away |
| Butcher's Block / Puppy Pose | 90 sec | Arms extended, chest sinking toward floor |
| Shoulder Circles | 10 each direction | Slow, full range |

#### Wrist Care (1-2 min)

| Exercise | Duration | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Wrist Flexor Stretch | 30 sec each | Fingers back, lean into stretch |
| Wrist Extensor Stretch | 30 sec each | Top of hand on floor, lean into it |
| Wrist Circles | 20 each direction | |

*Handstand practice loads your wrists daily. This maintenance prevents issues.*

#### Advanced Mobility Tools (Optional)

Once you have the basics dialed, add these Supple Leopard techniques:

**Banded Joint Distractions:**
| Target | Setup | Duration |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Hip Capsule | Band anchored low, loop around hip crease, step away to create tension, sink into lunge | 2 min each side |
| Shoulder | Band anchored high, loop around shoulder, step away, let band pull arm overhead | 2 min each side |
| Ankle | Band anchored low, loop around front of ankle, drive knee forward over toes | 2 min each side |

*The band creates space in the joint capsule — you'll feel positions open up that stretching alone can't reach.*

**Voodoo Floss (for stubborn areas):**
- Wrap a compression band tightly around a joint (knee, elbow, ankle)
- Move the joint through full range of motion while wrapped
- Unwrap after 2 minutes
- Blood rushes back in, improves tissue sliding surfaces
- Don't leave on longer than 2 min, don't go numb

**Lacrosse Ball Targeted Work:**
| Area | Technique |
|------|-----------|
| Glutes/Piriformis | Sit on ball, cross ankle over knee, roll around |
| T-spine | Two balls taped together, lie on them along spine, arms overhead |
| Plantar Fascia | Stand on ball, roll foot, spend time on tender spots |
| Forearms | Ball on table, roll forearm flexors and extensors |

*Spend 2 min per area. If it's spicy, you probably need it.*

## Running Guidelines

**To/From Outdoor Gym:**
- 15 min each way = 30 min total Zone 2 cardio
- Keep it conversational — you should be able to talk
- This is your primary fat loss driver
- Don't race. Consistency > intensity.

**Tuesday Easy Run / Active Recovery:**
- 30-45 min easy running OR
- 30 min walk + mobility OR
- 20 min easy run + 20 min stretching

**Saturday Long Run (if not climbing):**
- 45-60 min at easy pace
- Build duration over time, not speed
- Good podcast/audiobook time

---

## Climbing Integration

**Purpose:** Fun, pulling volume, grip strength, problem-solving

**Guidelines:**
- Don't project hard stuff the day before RR workouts
- It counts as pulling volume — if you climb hard, back off pull-up volume that week
- Bouldering = more intense, shorter. Top rope = more endurance.
- On RR deload weeks, climb for fun, don't push grades

**Suggested Approach:**
- Thursday: Regular session, work on technique and moderate problems
- Saturday (if climbing): Can push harder since Sunday is rest

---

## Benchmarks

Test these every 4 weeks (on deload week):

| Test | Measure | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Max Pull-ups | Total reps in one set | Stop when form breaks |
| Max Dips | Total reps in one set | Full ROM |
| Max Handstand Hold | Time (wall or free) | Best of 3 attempts |
| Pistol Squat Progress | Current level achieved | Both legs |
| L-Sit Hold | Max time | Note progression level |
| 5K Time (optional) | Time | If you want to track running |

---

## When to Adjust

**Signs it's working:**
- Progressing through exercise levels every 2-4 weeks
- Handstand hold time increasing
- Pull-up and dip numbers going up
- Weight trending down (slowly — 0.5-1 lb/week is ideal)
- Energy good, sleep good, enjoying training

**Signs to modify:**
- Stuck at same progression for 4+ weeks
- Joint pain (not muscle soreness)
- Dreading sessions consistently
- Always exhausted

**When to move on:**
- Handstand goal achieved — time for new skill targets
- Bodyweight strength goals hit — consider adding weighted progressions
- 6 months in — full program reassessment
