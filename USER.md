## Active Adjustments

*Temporary flags affecting training. Add when something comes up, remove when resolved.*

| Date | Flag | Impact | Expires |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| 2026-01-31 | Left plantar heel irritation | Bias toward calf/foot mobility + gradual loading; avoid sudden volume spikes on hard surfaces | When symptom-free 7–10 days |
| 2026-01-31 | Recurrent adductor/groin tightness (old strain) | Add short adductor mobility + isometrics; manage squat volume/depth when flared | When symptom-free 2+ weeks |
